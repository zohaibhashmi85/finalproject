# finalproject

Please review our final machine learning project to follow along with the planning, progress and successful creation of our final project - Using Machine learning to predicit cardiovasular disease.

Use this link to open the web-application - https://cvd-analysis.herokuapp.com/#hero.

Machine Learning models - RGB and Random Forrest Model 

                       - We used these models due to the high accuracy and the ability to work with cateogrical data. 


The web application is consisted with two prediction models. The first model to predicit whether the user is at a risk of a disease and the second model to predicit whether user is at risk of getting a heart disease.
